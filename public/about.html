<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've always been curious and eager for science ðŸ”­ðŸ§¬</p>

<p>My youth was marked by the Astronomy Olympiad - which granted me a medal -, courses at the planetarium, scientific activities - such as with urban bats -, physics tutoring, voluntary projects, and a lot of didactic consumption. Such interest led me to graduate in Physics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). During my undergraduate studies, I conducted scientific initiation in Gravitational Lensing at the Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF).

<p>After completing my degree, I felt the need to explore a new area, moved to a different country, and decided to pursue a master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Porto. For my master's thesis, I worked at the Interdisciplinary Center of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR), where I focused on the study of climate change. My research at CIIMAR was challenging and rewarding, as I was able to work on a project that I believe has the potential to have a significant impact.
</p>
<p>Now, as I embark on the next chapter of my career, I am eager to continue working in the field of programming and informatics. I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to contribute and make a positive impact.

<p>If you have any opportunities or suggestions for me, please do not hesitate to get in touch. I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore possible collaborations.</p>
